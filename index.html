        <h2>üìú Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          As I pursue my Bachelor of Technology degree at KIIT University with an expected 2024 graduation, I maintain an
          impressive academic record, boasting a current CGPA of 8.38. I have developed expertise across technical areas including
          C/C++, Python, MySQL, React.js, Machine Learning, Pandas, Node.js, HTML, and CSS. I supplement these technical skills
          with proficiencies in several soft skills such as problem-solving, leadership, adaptability, teamwork, and creativity.

        </p>
    
        <p>
          I apply my knowledge through hands-on internship experiences and self-driven projects. Recently, I completed a summer
          internship developing an AI-powered invoice management system using SQL, React, and machine learning models.
          Additionally, I spearhead the creation of web applications like a WhatsApp Chat Analyzer that provides insights via data
          analytics and a platform called Memories to share life events. Outside of tech, I demonstrate leadership by volunteering
          with organizations such as the Youth Red Cross.

        </p>
    
        <p>
          As highlighted by my academic and professional accomplishments, I offer a multifaceted skill set spanning both technical
          capabilities and interpersonal strengths. My experiences showcase an engaged student with diverse abilities to take on
          challenges in programming, data analysis, system design, and team collaboration. My drive to build technology solutions
          for real-world issues and natural leadership abilities make me well-positioned to excel in future roles.

        </p>
        <p>
          I believe my blend of technical expertise, solution-focused thinking, and collaborative leadership equip me to thrive in
          dynamic environments and drive impact through innovative problem-solving. As I continue honing these skills, I am eager
          to apply my strengths to new challenges that will expand my capabilities and allow me to create value.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>
    
        <p>
          As a driven student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree, I have spearheaded the development of various impressive
          projects that demonstrate my own technical skills and capacity for innovation. Most notably, I created a WhatsApp Chat
          Analyzer web application using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit. This app provides users insights into their
          chat patterns and trends by aggregating messages over time. I also led a team to build a face mask detection system
          using machine learning and OpenCV for real-time video analysis. Additionally, I developed the "Memories" web platform
          with MERN stack technology for users to preserve and share life events. Through self-directed projects like these, I
          exhibit abilities in areas ranging from data science to deep learning and full stack development.

        </p>
    
        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>
    
        <p>
          Complementing my own academic excellence and project innovation, I have showcased remarkable accomplishments for a
          student. I exercised my leadership abilities by coordinating large-scale blood donation drives and awareness campaigns
          for the Youth Red Cross. I have also demonstrated an aptitude for real-world impact through an internship developing an
          AI invoice management tool using SQL, React and predictive analytics. My work provided data-driven financial insights
          for enhanced business decision making. Furthermore, as a Campus Growth Manager, I expanded my university's brand
          presence by orchestrating marketing campaigns leveraging social media and digital channels. This commitment to driving
          progress - whether social, technological or organizational - highlights my own well-rounded achievements so far.

        <h2>üåÆ Projects Information</h2>
    
        <h3>WhatsApp Chat Analyzer Web App</h3>
        <p>
          Developed an interactive web application using Python and data visualization libraries to provide users analytics and
          insights on their WhatsApp chat history and patterns. Enables analysis of chat frequencies, busiest months, daily
          messages etc.

        </p>
        <h3>Face Mask Detection System</h3>
        <p>
          Led a team to build a machine learning model using OpenCV and Keras for real-time face mask detection in images and
          video streams. Trained a convolutional neural network on labeled dataset to accurately classify masked vs unmasked
          faces.

        </p>
        <h3>Memories Web Platform</h3>
        <p>
          Created a web application using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and authentication allowing users to
          chronicle and share life events and memories. Incorporates features like custom timeline entries, media upload, profiles
          etc.
